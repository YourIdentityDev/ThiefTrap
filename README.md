# ThiefTrap

ThiefTrap is a program designed to automatically execute in a fake Windows User as soon as someone logs into the specified account.

This tool can be particularly useful for safeguarding personal information by monitoring and potentially deterring unauthorised access to your device by a thief or other intruder.

<sub>Note: The fake Windows User should not have access to any files from other/main users and you should delete as much unnecessary data as possible to save storage space.</sub>
